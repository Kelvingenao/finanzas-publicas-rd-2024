## Were the Loans Necessary?

There is no absolute answer. Below are two reasonable viewpoints:

---

### 1. Yes, the loans were necessary:

- Even with a high annual surplus, **the funds are not available immediately**, as income is collected throughout the year.
- The government may require **liquidity at specific times**, and loans help cover urgent expenses before enough income is received.
- Some projects funded through loans (electric infrastructure, climate resilience, sustainability) may require **external specialized financing** or favorable technical conditions.

---

### 2. No, the loans were not necessary:

- Income is generated consistently during the year, indicating **active cash flow** to cover expenses.
- The loans were taken in **October and November**, when most of the year’s income had already been received.
- Certain months (e.g., January, February, April) showed **high collection levels** from tourism, customs, and internal taxes.
- The government could have **reduced non-priority expenses** or used **accumulated reserves** instead of borrowing.

---

### Analysis Limitations

- **Not all income sources were included** (e.g., energy plants like Punta Catalina).
- **Not all state expenditures were considered**, only the most relevant ones.
- The analysis is based on publicly available data, so **figures may not reflect 100% of the national budget**.

---

## Conclusion

This analysis does not aim to provide a definitive answer, but rather to present clear, data-driven arguments. Whether the loans were necessary depends on additional factors such as:

- **Actual budget execution**  
- **Conditions of the financial markets**  
- **Project management capacity**  
- **Timing of income vs. expenditure**

**What do you think?** Was the debt necessary or could it have been avoided?
